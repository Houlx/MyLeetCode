 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]'
 *
 * 
 * You are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always
 * smaller than the second number.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b
 * < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You
 * needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The longest chain is [1,2] -> [3,4]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The number of given pairs will be in the range [1, 1000].
